1. DA2_DR50
has D_A=2um2/s
D_R=50um2/s
D_C=1.9um2/s

Promoters have D=0.
D_RNA=5um2/s

2. DA5_DR50
same as above, except 
D_A=5um2/s

3. BothD1
D_A=1um2/s
D_R=1um2/s

This was run to verify whether the size of D_R was important, which it is not, only D_A seems to control the spatial distribution and the oscillation time.
