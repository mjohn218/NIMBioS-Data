A(t) vs t data for FPR and GFRD reports STDEV in 3rd column, over N=80 and 10 trajectories, respectively, 
FOR SEM divide by sqrt(Ntraj).

For fit to data (kfit values), each individual curve is fit, and then the AVG of this value and its SEM is reported!
This was done properly over all ntraj in the first place.
