FPR/NERDSS is averaged over 10 trajectories, dt=1e-7s. 
Printed only each 1e-5s, so 10 new short trajectories were run to get t=[1e-7:1e-5] with more time points. 

Smoldyn due to volume precision limits, had 613 particles at the begining, so rescaled by 602/613.
Use dt=1e-8, 1e-7, and 1e-6. As you increased dt, it moved closer to the PDE solution.
