50 simulations were run for each ka=10 and k1=1, both with kb=1.
box length=1000nm.

A0=B0=1000 (simulating A+B <=> C)

DA=DB=1, DC=0.5.

dt=0.1us.


copied original files (From JCP 2015 Figure 8)
averaged_50runs_k1.koff1.dat and
averaged_50runs_k10.koff1.dat

into 

fpr_1_traj50.dat
and
fpr_10_traj50.dat


the files
fpr_1_short_24traj.mat
and
fpr_10_short_24traj.mat

only went out to 0.1s, and only stored every 1000us
Osman ran these??
